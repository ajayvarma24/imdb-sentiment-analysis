IMDb Movie Review Sentiment Analysis
Overview
This project is a Django-based web application that performs sentiment analysis on IMDb movie reviews. Users can register, log in, and predict the sentiment of movie reviews using machine learning models. The system also provides visualization of training results and maintains a history of user predictions.

Multiple ML models trained: Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), XGBoost, SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree

Why Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB)?
Although XGBoost shows higher accuracy on the dataset, we use MNB as the default prediction model because:

MNB is faster and more efficient for text classification tasks like sentiment analysis

It requires less computational resources, making the web app more responsive

MNB performs robustly with text data when combined with TF-IDF features

It ensures smoother user experience, especially on shared or limited hosting environments

Users can consider integrating other models like XGBoost for improved accuracy if computational resources allow.

Dataset
The IMDb dataset containing movie reviews is used for training. Due to file size limits on GitHub, the dataset is tracked using Git Large File Storage (Git LFS). Make sure to install Git LFS before cloning the repository to handle the dataset properly.

Installation
